			<h4>This image of John Bull and Brother Jonathan joining hands as cable wires are being laid by two ships is a metaphorical representation of how the United States and Britain were in touch due to the telegraph. American steamboat “Niagara” and British steamboat “Agamemnon” are depicted since these ships are what laid out the cables, thus allowing for the accomplishment of the Atlantic telegraph cable. Brother Jonathan was a figure that personified New England and the whole of the U.S. Similarly, John Bull was often used in political cartoons like this image as a personification of England. In the political cartoon, the two figures discuss unity, peace, and diplomacy which describe the United States’ and Britain’s new partnership due to the telegraph. The transatlantic cable allowed for instantaneous communication between these two nations, creating a more globalized world. The lightning in the background is a symbol of the telegraph’s electric signals which made this global connection possible.
