			<h4>
				1. Samuel Morse invented the electric telegraph in collaboration with Leonard Gale and Alfred Vail. He created a single-circuit telegraph that transmitted messages between telegraph stations.
			</h4>

			<h4>
				2. The telegraph can send messages because electric current is sent through its wire and that current is broken in a pattern which indicates different letters in the alphabet using morse code.
			</h4>

			<h4>
				3. Across the Atlantic,the British team of Cooke and Wheatstone, in the 1830s developed a separate telegraph system.This system used five magnetic needles that could be pointed around a panel of letters and numbers by using an electric current.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				4. The Telegraph system spread across America and the world, aided by technological innovations. Such as the invention of good insulation for telegraph wires. The man behind this innovation was Ezra Cornell, one of the founders of Cornell University in New York.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				5. The telegraph impacted how journalists and newspapers conducted business. Instead of taking weeks for news to be delivered via horse-and-carriage mail carts, news could be exchanged between telegraph stations almost instantly.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				6. In 1848 the Associated Press was formed in the United States by five daily newspapers to share the expenses of transmitting news related to the Mexican-American War. In 1849 Paul Julius Reuters in Paris initiated a telegraphic press service. By 1851 more than 50 telegraph companies were in operation in the United States.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				7. Around the 1850s, the company, Western Union developed around the new medium of telegraph communication. In 1861 it completed the first transcontinental telegraph line, connecting San Francisco to the Midwest and then on to the East Coast. Western Union became the dominant telegraph company in the United States.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				8. By 1866, a telegraph line had been laid across the Atlantic Ocean from the U.S. to Europe. By 1940, 40 telegraph lines had been laid across the Atlantic. This helped globalize the world as different hemispheres of the world could communicate faster than ever done in the past.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				9. In 1874, Thomas Edison’s improvement to the medium allowed for four messages to be transmitted simultaneously using the same wire. It was called the Quadruplex system.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				10. The electric telegraph revolutionized communication. One of the biggest impacts were seen during wars, as messages could be sent and received at speeds not seen before. The Civil War saw a large amount of telegraphs in use, such as Lincoln and Grant’s telegrams discussing the war.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				11. The telegraph opened doors for money to be wired across great distances, thus having a profound impact economically. In February 1871, Western Union allowed customers to send money between New York, Chicago and Boston using the Western Union money transfer services. By the end of the year, they had expanded nationally, successfully uniting the country through remittances.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				12. By the end of the 19th century many new technologies emerged that were based on the same principle as the telegraph (e.g. telephone). Even though the telegraph has since been replaced by modern technology like telephones and the Internet, its invention stands as a turning point in history.
