			<h2>What were some drawbacks of the Telegraph?</h2>
			<h4>One major drawback of the Telegraph was having knowledge of Morse code. To send and receive messages operators needed to memorize Morse code, which was a series of short and long clicks. These clicks symbolized the dots and dashes which were representations of the alphabet.</h4>

			<br />

			<h2>Was there a word limit applied to messages sent via the Telegraph?</h2>
			<h4>Yes, telegraph users were restricted by word limit. During the late 19th-century telegraph boom, some carriers charged extra for words longer than 15 characters and for messages longer than 10 words. Thus, the cheapest telegram was often limited to 150 characters.</h4>

			<br />

			<h2>How much did it cost to send a message via the telegraph in or around the period of the American Civil War?</h2>
			<h4>Around the 1860s, a ten-word telegram sent from New York to New Orleans cost $2.70 which is about $95 today. When the transcontinental telegraph opened, the cost was $7.40 for ten words, which would equal $134 today. Over a period of time, prices decreased.</h4>
